# github-slugger-php

This is a PHP port of 
[Flet/github-slugger](https://github.com/Flet/github-slugger).  From 
the original README:

Generate a slug just like GitHub does for markdown headings. It also 
ensures slugs are unique in the same way GitHub does it. The overall 
goal of this package is to emulate the way GitHub handles generating 
markdown heading anchors as close as possible.

## Install

```
composer require devwrench/github-slugger
```

## Usage

Coming soon!
